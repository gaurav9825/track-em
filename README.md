# Track'em

### Problem

> During the time of any natural calamity or disaster people
> often panic and they tend to take wrong steps which could even worsen the situations, there thinking capabilities often tends to reduce at such times when they are so close to death.

### The Idea

> Track'em is an app to decode ways to prevent or provide best possible solutions through the use of technology, track down the person and provide immediate help.

I believe natural disasters cannot be stopped only neccessary action could be taken in order to minimize the casualities. The nature is very much unpredictable and literally anything can happen at any time, the only way is to be aware of how to survive in tough situations, which is
also not possible since we cannot expect everyone to be aware
of everything.

With this app we could save millions of lives every year as most of the times people often tend to give up as they have no hopes left. This app will help them to analyze the situation and come up with the best possible step that needs to be taken at that time that could save their lives. For example if someone is stuck in lightning this app could help them find nearest safe location using IOT and the best way to reach that location using gps so that they are not struck by the lightning. Another use case may be if someone is in an earthquake prone zone they can use this app to analyze the situation.

> Recently Scientists have discovered that a tiny sensor, the smartphone chip was found to record accurate data on earthquakes greater than magnitude five when placed close to the epicentre.

The person can know the severity of the earthquake and then can accordingly get in a safe zone which will also be told by the app. In case of cyclones or heavy winds also the app could prove out to be helpful as users can use the apps video recording feature to analyze live video in near real time with microsoft cognitive services APIs and using machine learning it could come up with best possible steps to be taken in order to survive along with sending his geolocation to people who could help him.

The app will use IOT along with image processing and real time video analysis to be able to give best possible results.
The app would require a lot of data in order to give best possible results.

#### Basic features

- Real Time Video Analysis
